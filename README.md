#Avocado Prices
Historical data on avocado prices and sales volume in multiple US markets.
This data was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of 2018 & compiled into a single CSV.
I have data where temporal ordering matters ,for that reason recurrent networks are a great fit and easily outperform models that first flatten the temporal data.
In this notebook, I will predict the average price of avocado using time-series modeling techniques
